TaskSy - A Task Management System
Portfolio Project for ALX Software Engineering

Project Description
TaskSy is a simple, intuitive, and efficient task management system designed to help individuals and teams organize, prioritize, and track their daily tasks. Built as a beginner-friendly backend project, it showcases foundational backend development concepts while delivering a functional and practical application. This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum, aimed at building practical skills in backend development, including API design, database management, user authentication, and deployment.

TaskSy allows users to:

Create and Manage Tasks: Add new tasks with details like title, description, deadline, and priority.
Organize Tasks into Categories: Categorize tasks into personal, work, errands, etc., for easy management.
Track Task Progress: Update the status of tasks (e.g., pending, in progress, completed).
Collaborate: Share tasks with team members and assign responsibilities.
Visualize Tasks: View tasks in a clean, user-friendly interface inspired by Trello boards.
Project Features
User Authentication:

Secure registration and login using JWT tokens.
Password hashing for secure storage.
Task Management:

Create, update, and delete tasks.
Add task descriptions, deadlines, and priority levels.
Categories:

Group tasks into customizable categories (e.g., Work, Personal).
Progress Tracking:

Mark tasks as "Pending," "In Progress," or "Completed."
View progress statistics in the dashboard.
Collaborative Features:

Assign tasks to specific team members.
Share task boards with collaborators.
Notifications:

Notify users about upcoming deadlines.
Learning Objectives
This project serves as a practical application of backend development skills, with the following objectives:

Understanding RESTful API design principles.
Mastering Node.js and Express.js for backend development.
Learning to implement MongoDB for database management.
Integrating third-party libraries like jsonwebtoken for authentication.
Deploying a backend application on platforms like Heroku or Render.
Understanding the importance of Trello-style task management systems.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: JavaScript (Node.js)
Framework: Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
Frontend Compatibility: Can integrate with React.js or Angular for the UI layer (optional).
Development Tools: Visual Studio Code, Postman for API testing
Third-Party Services (If Applicable)
SendGrid API: For email notifications.
Cron Jobs: For scheduling notifications or periodic tasks.
Cloudinary: For storing task-related media files.
Challenges Identified
Building secure user authetication and session management.
Efficiently managing large datasets using MongoDB.
Designing a user-friendly API that can integrate with frontend clients.
Handling real-time notifications and updates.
Target Audience
Individuals managing personal to-do lists.
Teams looking for a collaborative task-tracking tool.
Beginners exploring task management systems as a portfolio project.
Schedule of Work
The project will be completed over 4 weeks, with tasks organized in a Kanban board using Trello.

Week 1:

Initialize the repository and set up the development environment.
Implement user authentication (register, login, JWT tokens).
Week 2:

Build APIs for task management (create, update, delete, list tasks).
Integrate MongoDB and design data models.
Week 3:

Implement task progress tracking and category management.
Add collaborative features (assign tasks to users).
Week 4:

Finalize API with notifications and performance optimizations.
Write comprehensive documentation and deploy the project.
Mock-Up
The mock-up for TaskSy is inspired by Trello boards:

Task Board: Displays tasks in columns (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Completed).
Task Form: A simple form for creating or editing tasks.
Progress Dashboard: Displays statistics like the number of tasks per category and completion rates.
